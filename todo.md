1-Component Decomposition for Better Maintainability:
If the converter or conversion history grows in complexity,
consider breaking it into smaller, reusable components 
(e.g., a separate component for the conversion history table).


2Accessibility Enhancements:
Add proper aria-label attributes where needed 
(especially for interactive elements like buttons and slide toggles).
Use semantic HTML (e.g., <section>, <header>, <main>) for improved accessibility 
and readability.
